# Hash Clinic

All our hashes need to go to the clinic. Just kidding. We just have hashes of data
that came to us representing a series of clinics being managed by our software. Your
job, should you choose to take it on, will be to query into the deeply nested hash
and associate badly formed data. You will also be asked to create data in this array.
Good luck!

#### Gems

It only comes with the 'rspec' gem for testing. It also comes with files that
set the ruby version and the gemset. Once you pull down this project once, and
bundle gems, you shouldn't have to do it again. Your computer should just know
which Ruby and gemset to use.

## Getting Started

1. `bundle` to get your gems
2. Follow the tests that are written to guide you, on test at a time, towards code
3. Fill out the tests that only have descriptions and keep going
